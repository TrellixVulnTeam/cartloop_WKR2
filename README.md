This project is a simple SPA with React that simulates a text message conversation between two people.
In this case, the "other user" is the server.

Functionalities:

1. Ready to send messages are available via macros (by click)
2. Chatting via sockets.io
3. Server response with random answer when sending a message via 'resolve' button.
4. State is managed via UseContext.
5. Messages are validated against the following characters: aA-zZ1234567890-=.,
6. Design is fully responsive.
7. User gets notified when a message is invalid.
8. Tech stack: React.js, Hooks, Sass, Node.js, Express.

In the project directory, you can run:

npm start / start:dev

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

npm run build / build:prod
